        <p>You could never know what it's like <br>
            Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice<br>
            And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you <br>
            You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use <br>
            And did you think this fool could never win? <br>
            Well, look at me, I'm a-comin' back again <br>
            I got a taste of love in a simple way <br>
            And if you need to know while I'm still standin', you just fade away br
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't you know, I'm still standin' better than I ever did? <br>
            Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid <br>
            And I'm still standin' after all this time <br>
            Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Once, I never coulda hoped to win <br>
            You're startin' down the road, leavin' me again <br>
            The threats you made were meant to cut me down <br>
            And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            You know, I'm still standin' better than I ever did <br>
            Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid <br>
            And I'm still standin' after all this time <br>
            Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't you know that I'm still standin' better than I ever did? <br>
            Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid <br>
            And I'm still standin' after all this time <br>
            Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah) <br>
