        <p>You could never know what it's like
            Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
            And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
            You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
            And did you think this fool could never win?
            Well, look at me, I'm a-comin' back again
            I got a taste of love in a simple way
            And if you need to know while I'm still standin', you just fade away
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't you know, I'm still standin' better than I ever did?
            Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
            And I'm still standin' after all this time
            Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
        </p>
        <p>
            Once, I never coulda hoped to win
            You're startin' down the road, leavin' me again
            The threats you made were meant to cut me down
            And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now
        </p>
        <p>
            You know, I'm still standin' better than I ever did
            Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
            And I'm still standin' after all this time
            Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't you know that I'm still standin' better than I ever did?
            Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
            And I'm still standin' after all this time
            Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
            I'm still standin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
